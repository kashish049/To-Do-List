# To-Do-List
This project is a simple and elegant to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and productive. Designed with a clean and modern UI, this project demonstrates my frontend development skills and attention to detail.
